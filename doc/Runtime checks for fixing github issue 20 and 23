runtime check that:

* the triangle inequality always holds in surfaceDistR.

* the number of allowed recursions isn't depleted before the wanted precision is achieved.

* the two ingredients in the calculation of the currently achieved precison both have the same sign.

* the process of achieving improved precision doesn't stall or worsen before the wanted precision is achieved.
