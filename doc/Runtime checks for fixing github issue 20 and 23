runtime checks:

* triangle inequality always holds in surfaceDistR.

* number of allowed recursions isn't depleted before the wanted precision is achieved.

* runtime check that the two ingredients in the precison calculation both have the same sign.

* the process of achieving improved precision doesn't stall or worsen before the wanted precision is achieved.
