The main instances (which has their own files in 'instances') has the prefix 'my'
to indicate that it is specific/particular.
When a function takes an instance as argument, the parameter name replaces 'my'
with 'a' to indicate that any particular instance could be passed.

Both camelCase and under_case is used: the former for the more tightly bound words
and the latter for the more loosely bound words. ish.

Names can contain upper case letters. Letters are upper case when required by the
camelCase style, or when a word is the name of a constructor, in which case the
first letter of the word must be upper case.

When the words 'phi' and 'theta' have a capital R appended, like this: 'phiR' and
'thetaR', it means that they are measured in radians. Similarly 'phiS' and 'thetaS'
are measured in segments.

When to use phiR/thetaR and when to use azimuth/polar: The former is for concrete
values in the azimuth/polar axis'. The latter are the names for the two angular axis'
in the 3D polar coordinate system.
